       <UL>
       <LI> <b>Section 34 page 108</b>: &nbsp; 2, 3, 5 (a), 10, 13, 16 
(do problem 16 anyway you want, not necessarily using cosh and sinh,
	 the answer in the text uses also the fact that (2+sqrt{3})(2-sqrt{3})=1).
      <LI> <b>Section 31 page 97</b>: &nbsp; 1, 2, 3, 5 (b), 7, 9. For
	 9 use the textbook definition of Log(z) on page 94, which is defined at

	 with the textbook definition Log(z) is discontinuous at every negative real number.

	 Suggestion for 7: Either use the suggestion in the text, or

	 u(x,y)=constant, at a given point (a,b) on that curve, is
	 parallel to the line u_x(a,b)x+u_y(a,b)y=0, provided at least
	 one of the partials u_x(a,b) or u_y(a,b) does not vanish.
       <LI> <b>Section 31 page 97</b>: &nbsp; 10 (Method 1: check that 
its first and second partials are continuous and 
satisfies the laplace equation. Method 2: For every non-zero complex number c realize this function as the real part of an analytic function in some open set containing c).

 	<LI> <b>Section 39 page 125</b>: &nbsp; 1, 2, 6 (in part a, if
	 z(x) is on the x-axis, then y(x)=0, so z(x)=x, so show that

       <LI> <b>Section 62 page 205</b>: &nbsp; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Extra problem: Find
	 also the Laurant series of the function f(z)=z/(z-1)(z-3) in problem 6 in each
	 of the three annular domains centered at the origin in which it is
	 analytic (unit disk, the annulus 1<|z|<3, and the complement
	 of the disk of radius 3). Hint: Use partial fractions to write f(z)
	 as A/(z-1) + B/(z-3) and treat each summand seperately. A
	 similar example was worked out in class and can be also found <b>here:</b>: <a
	 href="/~markman/math421_fall20_html/lecture24-notes.pdf">Example</a>

Write cot(z)=sum_{n=-infinity}^infinity c_n z^n.

c_{n+1} in terms of the previous ones c_{-1}, c_0, …, c_n.
